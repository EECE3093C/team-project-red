# Proposal For Our Software Project

### What is our project? Who is it for?
Our product is a productivity application, similar to that of a planner, specifically designed for University of Cincinnati students. By taking in the users class assignments from Canvas, scheduled class times, and any other individual meetings or timed requirments, the application creates a sample daily schedules and prioritized things to do lists based on the users unique needs. Along with this, suggestions for breaks and rest time and study or food locations near the University of Cincinnati are also created.
### What problem does it solve?
Our product solves a problem that many college students face- the difficulty of creating a schedule and staying organized. This product functions as a calendar, planner, and to do list all in one. 
### What alternatives are available? Who are our competitors?
Some alternatives available are the built-in Calendar app on most cell phones, Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, ToDo, and the built in Canvas Calendar. 
### What is the novel in our approach?
Our product is different than the others that are already available because our product is the only one that has calendar, planner, AND todo list functionality. The reason it is so relevant for college students is due to our product getting information directly from Canvas.
