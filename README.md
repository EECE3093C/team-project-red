# Proposal For Our Software Project

### What is our product? Who is it designed for?
Our product is a productivity application, similar to that of a planner, specifically designed for University of Cincinnati students. By taking in the users class assignments from Canvas, scheduled class times, and any other individual meetings or timed requirments, the application creates a sample daily schedules and prioritized things to do lists based on the users unique needs. Along with this, suggestions for breaks and rest time and study or food locations near the University of Cincinnati are also created.
