# Proposal For Our Software Project

### What is our project? Who is it for?
Our product is a productivity application, similar to that of a planner, specifically designed for University of Cincinnati students. By taking in the users class assignments from Canvas, scheduled class times, and any other individual meetings or timed requirments, the application creates sample daily schedules and prioritizes a things to-do list based on the users unique needs. Along with this, suggestions for breaks or rest time and study or food locations near the University of Cincinnati are also created.
### What problem does it solve?
Our product solves a problem that many college students face- the difficulty of creating a schedule and staying organized. This product functions as a calendar, planner, and to-do list all in one. 
### What alternatives are available? Who are our competitors?
Some alternatives available are the built-in Calendar app on most cell phones, Microsoft Outlook, Google Calendar, ToDo, and the built in Canvas Calendar. 
### What is the novel in our approach?
Our product is different than the others that are already available because it not only includes a calendar, planner, and to-do list functionality, but also automatically generates daily schedules, rest times, and suggested food and study locations near the University of Cincinnati. The reason it is so relevant for college students is because our product gets class information and assignments directly from Canvas. Along with this, our approach is focused on University of Cincinnati students.
